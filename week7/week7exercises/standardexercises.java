/*1 Standard exercises
Always test your programs thoroughly!
1. Write a function (static method) odd, that takes three boolean inputs and returns true iff an
odd number of inputs are true.
2. Write a function majority, that also takes three boolean inputs and returns true iff at least
two of the arguments have the value true.
3. Write a function equal, that takes two arrays of integers as arguments, and returns true if
they contain the same number of elements and all corresponding pairs of elements are equal,
and false otherwise.
4. Write a function triangular, that takes three double values as arguments, and returns true
iff they could be the sides of a triangle (none of them is greater than or equal to the sum of
the other two).*/
